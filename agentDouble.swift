1. protectSecret Function

Purpose: This function's job is to create a protected "container" for a secret string. It takes a secret and a password, and it returns a new function (a closure) that acts as a gatekeeper for the secret. Only someone who knows the correct password can unlock the secret.

Parameters:

_ secret: String: The string you want to protect. The _ suppresses the need for an argument label when calling the function.
withPassword password: String: The password required to access the secret. The withPassword argument label is mandatory when calling the function.
Return Type: (String) -> String

This indicates that protectSecret returns a function. The returned function:
Takes a String as input (this will be the user's password attempt).
Returns a String (either the secret, or an error message).
Implementation (the Closure):


return { (attempt: String) -> String in
    if attempt == password {
        return secret
    } else {
        return "Sorry. No hidden secrets here."
    }
}
This is a closure (an anonymous function). It's the function that protectSecret returns.
 (attempt: String) -> String in: This defines the closure's input and output: It takes a String named attempt (the user's password attempt) and returns a String.
if attempt == password { ... }: This compares the user's attempt to the password that was originally passed into protectSecret. The key here is that the closure captures the password from the outer function's scope. This means the closure "remembers" the password, even after protectSecret has finished executing.
return secret: If the passwords match, the closure returns the secret that was originally passed into protectSecret. Again, the closure captures the secret.
else { return "Sorry. No hidden secrets here." }: If the passwords don't match, the closure returns an error message.
Example Use:


let myProtectedFunction = protectSecret("MySuperSecretData", withPassword: "MyStrongPassword")

print(myProtectedFunction("wrongPassword"))   // Output: Sorry. No hidden secrets here.
print(myProtectedFunction("MyStrongPassword"))  // Output: MySuperSecretData
2. generateCombination Function

Purpose: This function generates a combination (a tuple of three integers) based on a given room number and a transformation function. It applies the transformation function repeatedly.

Parameters:

forRoom room: Int: The room number (an integer).
usingFunction f: (Int) -> Int: A function that takes an integer as input and returns an integer. This is the transformation function that will be applied repeatedly.
Return Type: (Int, Int, Int)

This means the function returns a tuple containing three integers.
Implementation:


let first = f(room)
let second = f(first)
let third = f(second)
return (first, second, third)
let first = f(room): Applies the f function to the room number and stores the result in first.
let second = f(first): Applies the f function to the first result and stores the result in second.
let third = f(second): Applies the f function to the second result and stores the result in third.
return (first, second, third): Returns the three calculated integers as a tuple.
Example Use:


let myCombination = generateCombination(forRoom: 123, usingFunction: { x in (x * 2) % 100 })
print(myCombination) // Output: (46, 92, 84)
3. makeCombo Function

Purpose: This is a specific example of a transformation function that can be used with generateCombination. It takes an integer, multiplies it by 13, and then takes the remainder after dividing by 256 (modulo operation). This is often used to generate seemingly random numbers within a specific range.

Parameter:

_ x: Int: The integer to transform.
Return Type: Int

Returns the transformed integer.
Implementation:


(x * 13) % 256
This performs the multiplication and modulo operation.
Example Use:


let transformedValue = makeCombo(50)
print(transformedValue)  // Output: 146
Key Concepts Recap:

Closures: Self-contained blocks of code that can capture and store references to variables from their surrounding context. They are essential for creating functions that "remember" values.
Higher-Order Functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as values. This allows for flexible and reusable code.
Functions as First-Class Citizens: The ability to treat functions like any other value (assign them to variables, pass them as arguments, return them from functions).
Tuples: A way to group multiple values together into a single compound value.
Argument Labels: Used to improve the readability of function calls by providing context for the arguments being passed.
